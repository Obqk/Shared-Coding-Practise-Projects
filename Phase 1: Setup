******Phase 1: Setup******

This is where we'll start off - with the basics.

There will be three sub-sections:
  1. Graph Setup
  2. Point Definition
  3. Function and Data Setup
  
1.1 Graph Setup
  This is basically learning how to set up a table or a graph (grid) through code. 
  Once we know this, we can use this setup to incorporate things like points and lines and whatnot. 
  But basically we're drawing a square which we can put points onto. 
  
  ---Task: Initialize a grid---
  
1.2 Point Definition
  This incorporates the previous section - we have a graph, and now we learn how to put a point on the graph.
  Obviously sounds easy but it's worth learning how to actually do it so it won't be a problem in the future, in terms of 
    points being where they shouldn't be and not knowing why. 
  Once we know how to put points on a graph, we can basically play around with the points we have on the graph to see what happens. 

  ---Task: Plot a point on a grid---

1.3 Function and Data Setup
  So this is basically learning how to organize different data and how to write functions in code.
  Organizing data just means things like sorting the data, randomizing the data, categorizing the data, etc. because we can 
    pick what we want to do. Sometimes the best thing to do is also just to store the data in the order it comes in (chronological).  
  Writing the functions is just so we know how to write plots in code - nothing too fancy. But it leads up to being able to write
    stuff like those benchmark functions we did in the algorithms project. We can start off with simple functions like x^2, or 2x+3,
    nothing too crazy just so we get the basic concepts. 
    
  ---Task: Store data of a given function--
  (Do so by storing the data values for f(x) = 9x+9 for the doman of x values between -10 and 10)
